# 🛡️ netmon01 – Home Network Threat Monitor

## 📘 Project Overview
`netmon01` is a Python-based script that captures live network traffic and detects basic suspicious activity. It uses the `pyshark` library to interface with Wireshark's TShark engine, printing and logging traffic in real-time. This is the first project in my Cloud + Industrial Cybersecurity portfolio, designed to build practical, defensive security skills.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- PyShark (TShark wrapper)
- Wireshark & TShark
- Linux (Kali)
- Virtual Environment (venv)
- Log-based detection logic

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Learn to sniff live network packets using Python
- Identify suspicious activity such as Telnet usage (port 23)
- Log traffic to a timestamped log file
- Work inside isolated Python environments for safe, portable development
